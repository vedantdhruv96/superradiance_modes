# superradiance_modes

The mathematica nb computes the frequency spectra for a spin-0 scalar field (Klein-Gordon field) on a Kerr background.
Two kinds of solutions arise: quasinormal modes (diverging at infinity) and bound states (decaying to zero at infinity).
The frequencies are computed using the continued fraction method (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1985.0119).
The plots are organized according to https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2880
